## Hello, there!
I'm Brandon Michelsen, welcome! I've been a passionate embedded systems and software engineer for 7 years now, split between university and industry. \
Throughout my career, I've been extremely intersted audio processing and DSP. This blog documents my journey as I learn more about DSP. I'll be documenting what I learn here, as well as my completed projects.\

## A little more about me...
I've been an embedded systems engineer in industry for 3 years. I have skills with Python, C++, and C, mostly working with ARM Cortex-M devices. I have a passion for audio and music as well, and have been learning music my whole life: composing my own music, learning new instruments, etc. Digital Signal Processing is the combination of my passion for engineering and music, and I hope to have fun learning it!\
