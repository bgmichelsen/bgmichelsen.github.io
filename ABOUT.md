## Hello, there!
I'm Brandon Michelsen, welcome! I've been a passionate embedded systems and software engineer for over 8 years, split between university and industry.

Throughout my career, I've been extremely interested in all things embedded: firmware development, electronics design, robotics, digital signal processing, mechatronics...you name it! This blog was made to document my projects and thoughts in relation to mechatronics, signal processing, and firmware.


## A little more about me...
I've been an embedded systems engineer in the industry for over 4 years. I have skills with Python, C++, and C, mostly working with ARM Cortex-M devices. Mechatronics, signal processing, and embedded systems combines my passions for physics and engineering. I hope to have fun learning it!
