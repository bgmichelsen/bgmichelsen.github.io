# General Software Guidelines

These are the general guidelines for software projects. These guidelines apply regardless of language.

## Project Structure

Follow the folder structures outlined in [General Project Guidelines](/project-guidelines/general.md).

## Architecture

### Design

Always architect a software project before writing code. Draw UML diagrams for classes, flow diagrams for logic, and timing diagrams for interrupts and task-based systems.

This ensures that the design has been thought out beforehand, and ensures that code structure can be more streamlined and the necessary software components have been identified.

### Data Structures

When designing software, make good use of existing data structures. Apply judicious use of queues, stacks, and other structures to the benefit of the program.

### Interfaces

When designing software classes, design the class interface before implementation. The class interface includes the public-facing member functions, structures, and definitions.

When designing a class, make good use of SOLID design principles.

## Idioms

Make good use of the idioms of the language being used for a software project.
