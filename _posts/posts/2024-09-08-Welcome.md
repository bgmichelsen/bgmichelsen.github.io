# Welcome!

Hello! Welcome to my blog. Here I will be documenting my journey through Digital Signal Processing (DSP) and its application in audio and music.


I will be going through a combination of desktop development and embedded development throughout this blog, mostly working in C++ and Python.


On the desktop side of things, I will be using [Visual C++](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/features/cplusplus/) and the [JUCE](https://juce.com/) audio framework. 
These two tools will let me build desktop applications and audio plugins for Digital Audio Workstations, such Ableton Live.


As for the embedded side of things, I will be mostly working with ARM Cortex-M devices, as that is what I am most familiar with. The [RP2350](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/rp2350/) 
by Raspberry Pi is the device I'll be using the most, with their [Pico 2 Dev Board](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-pico-2/) being my main development board.


I'll be listing more of the specifics with each post.


I am excited to start learning, and I hope you'll follow along with me!
