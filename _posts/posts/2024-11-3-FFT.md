# The Fast Fourier Transform

In my last post, we took a look at the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT). We saw that this allows us to
decompose any time domain signal into a series of sinusoid signals with varying frequencies and 
amplitudes. 

However, the DFT is a very computationally intensive process. Looking closely at the DFT equation:

$$X\left[n\right] = \sum_{k=0}^N x\left[k\right]e^{-j\frac{2\pi}{N}kn}$$

We can see that we need two loops: an inner loop that sums all $$N$$ samples of the signal for the given
frequency bin $$X\left[n\right]$$; and an outer loop that loops through each frequency bin.

If you're familiar with Big-O notation, this is roughly a complexity of $$O\left(N^2\right)$$, meaning 
a that the execution time of the algorithm is roughly squared based on the amount of samples.

For the DFT to be useful in any application, we need a more efficient way to calculate it. This is where
the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) comes in.

## Making Things Fast

The FFT takes advantage of repeated calculations within the DFT. The process was published by James Cooley
and John Tukey in 1965. Cooley and Tukey found that, when the number of samples of a given signal is a power
of 2, then certain samples repeat themselves for each sinusoid. 

Let's take a closer look at this. The graph below shows a cosine signal at 0 Hz. Samples 0 (green dot) and 
4 (blue dot) have been highlighted.

If we increase the frequency to 1 Hz, we can see that those two samples remain the same.

It's the same with 2 Hz and 4 Hz, the samples remain in the same points on the signals.

![4 Hz Cosine](/img/fft_4hz_cos.PNG)

The FFT takes advantage of the fact that these samples remain the same for different sinusoids. It remembers 
these repeated calculations so that they don't need to be recalcuated!

## Memory by Sorting

So, how does the FFT remember the repeated calculations? By sorting the samples based on how often the 
calculations repeat themselves. This is often explained as a divide-and-conquer method, repeatedly dividing 
the samples into even and odd samples until there is only a pair of even-odd samples for each group. It then 
repeatedly calculates a 2-point DFT for each pair, combining each result into the final calculation.

(Note: The sorting process can be implemented different ways, the two most common being recursive function 
calls and bit-reversal sorting).

## The Butterfly

The 2-point DFT results in the following flow diagram, named the Butterfly Diagram.

In the diagram, the red line represents the even sample and the blue line the odd sample. 

In equation form, the butterfly would be the two following equations:

$$X_1 = x_{even} + x_{odd}$$

and

$$X_2 = x_{even} - Wx_{odd}$$

Pretty simple, right? But what is the multiplication by $$W$$ for? What exactly *is* $$W$$?

$$W$$ is a twiddle factor. This twiddle factor is there to correct for a phase shift that 
happens when we decomposed our samples into even and odd groups. This phase shift isn't an 
issue with the first group of 2-point DFTs, but it becomes an issue as we start combining the 
results.

The twiddle factor can be calculated as a complex constant with the following equation: 

$$W = \cos{(2\pi\frac{O}{I})} - j\sin{(2\pi\frac{O}{I})}$$

Where:
- $$O$$ is the outer loop count, or index, of the given Butterfly Equation
- $$I$$ is the inner loop count of the Butterfly Equation

The calculation of $$W$$ is a little *complex* (pun intended), but overall not so excruciating 
that we can't easily implement it in code.

## Conclusion

So, that's the basics of the FFT. It basically saves repeated calculations to save time when 
performing computations, bringing the $$O(N^2)$$ down to $$O(N\log{N})$$ time, drastically 
reducing how many computations we need and making the DFT much more practical.

Now that we understand how the FFT works, it's time to implement it using Juce. That'll be the 
topic of my next post, see you there!
