So, one thing I've noticed with my recent projects: they are messy. I tend to jump right in to making things - writing code, building a prototype, etc. This doesn't seem to have a good end result. I may end up with a project that works, but the code is difficult to read, the design may not be optimized, and it can be a struggle to remember what I did to accomplish the end result.

That's why I've added a new section to this website: the [Guidelines](/guidelines) section. This has several project guidelines for me to follow when I'm working on a project, to help keep my projects standardized and my work streamlined.

Mainly, this identifies how to start a project, regardless of if its a mechanical, electrical, software, or combined project. It also includes guidelines for each discipline, allowing me to better design and build my projects.
