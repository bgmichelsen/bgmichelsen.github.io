# Update: I'm Back!

Hello, all! It's been a while. 

I've been pretty busy for the past few months. For one thing, 
I got married! I'm hoping to post more consistently the next 
several months. My next post will be the demo for the FFT project,
and will be my final post in the FFT series. 

That being said, I am changing a few things about this blog. 
It will no longer be targeted to just DSP topics, instead branching 
out into mechatronics, control theory, and other embedded systems or 
physics topics. I look forward to exploring all these with you!
